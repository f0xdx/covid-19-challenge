# COVID-19 Challenges

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) offers several challenges to answer question wrt the
ongoing *COVID-19* pandemic. This repo is a collection of material and notebooks to
explore the provided datasets, maybe participate in the challenges at a later point
in time.

Currently active challenges are

 * [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
 * [COVID-19 Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1)


## Installation

You will need a working environment containing [git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). In addition, you will need a text editor
/ browser if you plan to work with the code. We recommend a unix based setup and the
awesome [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
which offers a great
[python development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) experience,
including embedded notebooks.

With these components in place, you can just

```bash
git checkout covid-19-challenge
pipenv install --dev
```
